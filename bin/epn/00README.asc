  			EPN Data format - Version 6.01
===============================================================================

This directory contains the sample EPN software and presently consists of
the following files....

00README       - this file

epnfmt.ps      - A&A paper describing the original format (Lorimer et al. 1998)

Makefile       - UNIX Makefile 
Makefile.PC    - PC Makefile

epnhdr.inc     - include file defining the EPN header variables
rwepn.f        - read and writing routine for EPN data
arg.f          - shell UNIX routine for command line input compatibility
arg.msf        - shell Microsoft routine for command line input compatibility
arg.dos        - shell routine for command line input compatibility
plotepn.f      - routine for plotting EPN data
viewepn.f      - routine to view the header information of an EPN file

epnpol.f       - program to reduce polarisation data in EPN formatted files

example.f      - example program showing how to read EPN data.

asc2epn.f      - example program showing how to convert your data to EPN

baseline.f     - example program to adjust baseline to zero (used in asc2epn.f)
0437           - ASCII file with sample data for conversion by asc2epn
0437.inf       - header information for use by asc2epn
gl97           - ASCII file with sample data for conversion by asc2epn
gl97.inf       - header information for use by asc2epn

0437.epn       - sample EPN file data for J0437-4715 from Bell et al. (1997)
                 [this last file was created from 0437 and 0437.info
                  using asc2epn]

0329.epn       - sample single pulse data (20 consecutive pulses) for 0329+54 
		 observed simultaneously at Jodrell Bank and Bologna. See
		 the paper epnfmt.ps for details.

gl97.epn       - polarisation profile of B1831-04 (Gould & Lyne 1997)
hx97b.epn      - polarisation profile of B0355+54 (Hoensbroech & Xilouris 1997)

1012.epn       - profile of the millisecond pulsar J1012+5307
2145.epn       - profile of the millisecond pulsar J2145-0750
		 [these last two were observed using the Effelsberg 
		  100-m telescope at 1.4 GHz (Kramer et al.1998)]

The present package contains three programs - plotepn and viewepn
which can be used to plot and view EPN files respectively. They both
use the general reading/writing routines contained in the file
rwepn. As well as a starting point for integrating the format into
your own software, the programs are fairly useful in their own
right. N.B. plotepn assumes that you have PGPLOT installed on your
computer. The third program: example.f demonstrates how to convert
data into EPN format. It has one sample input file example.asc which
will produce the 0437 data given above.

To compile the software just issue the gloriously simple command:

make

- first in the epnlib directory to make the library
- second in this directory.

if this has worked without any nasty errors (if it doesn't the
then you will be ready to play with EPN files which can be downloaded
from the archive directly http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/pulsar/data/.
If it didn't work, the Makefile will most likely need to be altered
to your specific needs - some tips are given in the Makefile itself.
One problem may be with the operating system you wish to compile
the software on. The programs were developed under HP Unix and the
default parameters in Makefile reflect this. However, they have been
successfully ported to other UNIX systems and PCs (see Makefile.PC
for an example PC Makefile which uses Microsoft Fortran as the compiler)
Don't hesitate to send email to me should you have any problems.

To get you started, the file 0437.epn contains some sample data
from this famous pulsar published by Bell et al. (1997) taken with the 
Parkes Radio Telescope at 1520 MHz. In addition, there are some
single pulse of 0329+54 as well as total intensity profile of
J1012+5307 and J2145-0750. See above for details.

I'd be interested in any comments/suggestions you have on these
routines plus the format itself. I do have plans to write C-versions
of the software one of these days... before I get bombarded with comments
about being an out-of-date Fortran-77 hacker!

Bonn - October 1997

Note that there is now an additional program "epnpol" written by
Alexis von Hoensbroech to reduce polarisation data in EPN format.
Simply typing epnpol (once it has compiled) will list the available
options. Documentation on this may become available in the future.
Please contact Alexis von Hoensbroech (avh@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de) for
specific questions on this program.

Bonn - February 1998

Made various updates to include epnlib, epn2asc and the latest versions
of plotepn and epnpol.
